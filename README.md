I have been programming for fun for the last 25+ years. For about the last 10 years I have been also programming professionally. I have been retired for almost two years (from a real job) and now just do freelance programming. I am about to take it to the "next level" and join my sisters and brothers in the programming community. Try to be more active and contribute.
